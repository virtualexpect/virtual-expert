      "If you are planning to grow your business by selling products on Amazon, which is the most popular platform for sellers and shoppers, there is some homework you will have to do. Among several other vital steps one is getting UPC barcodes that is accepted by amazon.  UPCs for amazon are obtained through the most legitimate organization that is the GS1.",
    subTitle_1: "What is  UPC/Barcode for Amazon?",
    description_2:
      "A barcode consists of bars and spaces of varying widths readable with an optical barcode scanner. Barcodes are present on most of the items sold today and are used to identify and trace a product in the supply chains. Different types of barcodes are used in the market since the trading system evolved. Some of them are <br /> <ul style='display : block'><li style='list-style-type: disc'>Code 39</li><li style='list-style-type: disc'>Code 128</li><li style='list-style-type: disc'>Interleaved 2 of 5</li><li style='list-style-type: disc'>Universal products Codes (UPC)</li><li style='list-style-type: disc'>European Article Number (EAN)</li><li style='list-style-type: disc'>PDF417</li><li style='list-style-type: disc'>Data Matrix</li><li style='list-style-type: disc'>Quick Response (QR) Codes</li></ul> UPC is the short form of Universal Product Code. It consists of a 12 digit number assigned to the retail merchandise, identifying the vendor selling the product and the product. UPC is the most common form of barcode used in the US.

    description_3:
      "UPC barcodes for amazon are fantastic tools to keep track of the product information and inventory and are beneficial for retailers and manufacturers. It helps to keep track of the product in the global supply chain and regulates the supply according to the demand in an organized manner. UPC barcodes were initially used in the grocery industry but now are used in almost every type of retail business. The popularity of this barcode is due to the ease of using it. It also allows the retailers to add other necessary information and the price of each product with the barcode.",
    subTitle_3: "How is UPC scanned?",
    description_4:
      "When a UPC barcode for amazon or any marketplace is read with a scanner, it immediately gives the information about the product it is present on. So a product can be precisely identified at any place, i.e., within its departments, between the retailer and the manufacturer, inventory, shipping or point of sale. The scanning device reads the code in the form of bars of various widths and lengths. This sequence is converted into the product's information on a computer, smartphone or tablet with the help of barcode software.  ",
    subTitle_4: "How to find a UPC barcode for Amazon?",
    description_5:
      "It is unnecessary to get a barcode for every product you sell, but it can be helpful for your product supply and movement. To get a UPC barcode, you will have to join the GS1 and get a unique GS1 Company Prefix.  This prefix, a unique set of digits, identifies your company as the authorized manufacturer of your product supply chain.  With this prefix, you can use up to 100 UPCs. You may not need a company prefix for internal usage, but it will be required when you sell your products in retail stores where official UPC barcodes are needed. <br /> Calculate the number of products for which you need a UPC barcode. If you are selling a shirt and it is available in 4 different colors, you will need four barcodes for the product. Each color will have a different barcode. Furthur if three sizes are available in each color, each size will have a different code. Meaning you will need 12 barcodes for all shirts of different colors and sizes. <br /> Secondly, the number of digits your company prefix will have is calculated from the total number of barcodes you require. Suppose you want 5327 ( 4 digits) barcodes, then your company prefix will have 11-4=7 digits, and the 12th digit is the check digit which is also mathematically calculated from the 11 digits.",
    subTitle_5: "How much does it cost to get a UPC barcode for amazon?",
    description_6:
      "The cost of the UPC barcode depends upon the number of barcodes you require. Then there is an initial fee and annual renewal fee accordingly.<table class='table'><thead><tr><th scope='col'>Number of Products</th><th scope='col'>Initial Fee</th><th scope='col'>Annual Renewal Fee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 – 10</td><td>$250.00</td><td>$50.00</td></tr><tr><td>11 – 100</td><td>$750.00</td><td>$150.00</td></tr><tr><td>101 – 1,000</td><td>$2,500.00</td><td>$500.00</td></tr><tr><td>1,001 – 10,000</td><td>$6,500.00</td><td>$1,300.00</td></tr><tr><td>10,001 – 100,000</td><td>$10,500.00</td><td>$2,100.00</td></tr><tr><td>NDC/NHRIC Company Prefix</td><td>$2,100.00</td><td>$2,100.00</td></tr></tbody></table>  <br /> You can select the way you want to incorporate the barcode on your product. By receiving them in file format, you can add them to your packaging design with Adobe Photoshop. They are also available in the form of physical barcodes with your unique UPCs, and you can paste these labels on your products. <br /> There are some legitimate third-party UPC sellers as well. They buy barcodes in bulk from the GS1, and you can buy from them as well. In this way, you can buy cheap UPCs compared to the GS1, but they will have the third party's company name, and some big retailers, including Amazon, will not accept these barcodes. So if you are planning to buy UPCs for amazon, it is better to get them from GS 1. <br /> If you are willing to sell your products on Amazon, it is necessary to buy the UPCs from the GS1 because if your UPCs do not match the information on the GS1 database, Amazon will not accept your  UPCs. You may need barcodes for Amazon FBA. ASINs and GTINs are also terms you may come across while getting barcodes for Amazon. Let's have an introduction to these terms.",
    subTitle_6: "Amazon FBA",

It is crucial to fully understand and follow the guidelines given on the website and open your account in compliance with the recommended procedure.

GTINs are among the several numbers that are used to identify products sold on amazon. ISBN ( International Standard Book Number ) and JAN ( Japanese Article Number are also among the GTINs used in the Amazon catalog. <br /> For most categories, you must provide the GTIN in the Amazon platform to create a new listing.

    description:
      "As of 2021, about <u>2 million people</u> are selling products through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA). This setup allows sellers to choose their product and supplier while letting Amazon handle all the logistical needs – packing, shipping, and returns. <br /> <div className='d-flex'> <div>The success of your business hinges on four pillars: product, supplier, marketing, and customer satisfaction. For the first three, you can carefully strategize them in the beginning but for the long haul, you need to build up the reputation of your product to maintain customer loyalty. <br /> Before clicking Amazon’s add-to-cart button, wise buyers thoroughly check the product if it meets their desired quality, based on its description and specifications. Another great way to evaluate its quality is by reading customer reviews.</div></div> By reading an Amazon product review, prospect buyers can glean useful insights about your product and if it truly lives up to its promised features. <br /> Gaining a significant amount of positive customer reviews helps a business improve its conversation rates and pushes them up in Amazon's search results ladder. An Amazon verified review strengthens the marketing position of your product. <br /> Amazon encourages its customers to submit honest reviews, whether favorable or unfavorable. In fact, in 2016, Amazon revised its terms of service, wherein they prohibited compensating users with free or discounted products for writing good reviews.",
    subTitle_1: "Why Your Business Needs Amazon Product Reviews",
    description_2:
      "About <u>88% of customers</u> perceive online reviews as personal recommendations. Successful branding often comes from word-of-mouth, but an Amazon product review works the same way because it voices out personal testimonies of the product’s users. <br /> People are more likely to purchase products that have been proven and tested compared to those that none has ever tried. When customers study reviews, they grasp more in-depth details about the product and how it could fit their specific needs realistically. In effect, this helps them make an informed decision to make a purchase. <br /> Prospect buyers can pick up a customer’s honest sentiment, what features the customer likes, and what areas need to be improved. ",
    subTitle_2: "How Negative Reviews Ruin Your Business",
    description_3:
      "Customer reviews can make or break the success of your business. Prospects are often hesitant to purchase products that are flagged as below expectation. Amazon negative reviews can draw your customers away, damage your reputation, lower your Amazon search ranking, and worse, affect your profitability. <br /> <b>Customer-Repellant</b> <br /> One glance at a negative review can create a cloud of doubt in the buyer's mind, preventing customers to even try your product. Or if you have a bunch of loyal patrons, they might not be as loyal anymore. <br />When customers negatively comment about your product or service, prospects tend to look for other competitor brands that offer similar products. <br /> <b>Damaged Reputation</b> <br /> Negative customer reviews can have a long-term effect on your business because it destroys your perceived reliability. It’s frustrating to think that the reputation you worked so hard to build can easily collapse with just a few critiques. <br /> <b>Reduced Search Engine Ranking</b> <br /> When your rating drops, so does your search ranking. This is so because search engines are designed to offer users the best enterprises. <br /> <b>Income Loss</b> <br /> The bottom line for lost customers is lost income. According to Forbes, 94% of customers avoid a company with poor reviews. It’s just hard to convince customers to buy products from a brand with low ratings.",
    subTitle_3: "The Difference Between Verified & Fake Reviews in Amazon",
    description_4:
      "Upon checking your chosen product, you saw that it garnered a large number of reviews. Before jumping to conclusions, make sure to dig deeper and check if the reviewers are authentic.<br /> There are trustworthy reviews but there are also those that tend to be misleading and are worth scrutinizing. <br /> Verified product reviews belong to clients that purchased the product, left product reviews, and were verified later on by Amazon. In short, verification equates to transparency and credibility.<br /> Verified and fake reviews differ in how they read. If one review seems to sound dubious compared to other reviews, there’s a high possibility that these claims are not trustworthy.<br /> Another sign that the review is fake is the abundance of extreme reviews (one star and 5 stars), but the writeup contains very few words.",
    subTitle_4: "Amazon Review Guidelines and Amazon Vine Program",
    description_5:
      "Today, Amazon manages its incentivization of reviews through the Amazon Vine Program. Though Amazon charges their vendors with an enrollment fee per product, this remarkable development reinforces their credibility.<br />Amazon Vine manages the reviewing activities in Amazon. This program invites the most credible Amazon reviews to give their honest opinion. As a result, customers interested in the same product can decide upon it easily.<br />Amazon names the invitees as Vine Voices, which is based on their reviewer rank.  Amazon then provides Vine members with free products that were previously submitted by vendors. <br />Can anyone join the program? Yes, but you have to be invited by Amazon to do so. It's not something that you have to apply for. Amazon chooses its Vine Voices based on a set of criteria, particularly on how a review has helped the customer develop a sense of interest in the product or related products. <br />Those who consistently leave helpful reviews and become experts in a particular category have higher chances of being invited. Recent reviews are also given more weight. You can visit <u>How Ranking works</u> for more details on reviewer rankings.<br />The great thing about Amazon’s Vine Program is that it encourages reviewers to be honest, whether it's positive or negative.
